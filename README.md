# Bayesian analysis of pulsars features using Nested Sampling

## Model

We test the possibility that neutron stars may receive off-center natal kicks at birth, which imprint a natal rotation. In this scenario, the observed pulsar spin and transverse velocity in the Galaxy are expected to correlate. We develop a model of the natal rotation imparted to neutron stars and constrain it by the observed population of pulsars in our Galaxy.

## Data

Data are downloaded from the website of the [Australian Telescope National Facility](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/).

## Code

We adopt a Nested sampling algorithm for evaluating Bayesian evidence.
